## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to **Python Practice Sets (Python-PS)** – a dedicated repository created as part of my Python learning journey.

This repository contains **well-structured practice questions** and their **solutions**, covering essential Python concepts from beginner to intermediate level. Every chapter focuses on a specific topic, making it a perfect resource for learning, revision, or interview preparation.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Strengthen logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Revise Python concepts chapter-wise
- Provide **clean and well-commented solutions** for better understanding
- Help students, beginners, and programmers prepare for coding interviews or practice exams

## 🌟 Why I Created This Repository
While learning Python, I realized that **practicing problems** is the most effective way to master any programming language. Therefore, I:
✅ Collected important practice questions  
✅ Solved each question with clear logic  
✅ Documented the solutions publicly to help others

This has helped me improve my coding confidence and can be useful for anyone starting their Python journey.
