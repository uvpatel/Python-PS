# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z


# Enter numartor

n = int(input("Enter number: "))

# Enter denominator
d = int(input("Enter number: "))


if(n%d == 0):
    print(f"{n} is divisible by {d} ")

else:
    print(f"{n} is not divisible by {d}")
